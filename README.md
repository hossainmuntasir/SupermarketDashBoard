The analysis provides valuable insights into customers' purchasing behavior, shipping preferences, sales frequency, consumer demographics, regional sales, product performance, sales item quan􀆟ty, impact of discoun􀆟ng on sales, and profitability of different product categories. Key findings include the observa􀆟on of dis􀆟nct sales paterns across different months, with September standing out as a month of high sales. The majority of customers preferred the standard class shipping mode, and office supplies had the highest sales contribu􀆟on.

The regression analysis revealed a posi􀆟ve rela􀆟onship between sales and profit, with sales explaining approximately 44.65% of the varia􀆟on in profit. These insights can guide decision-making processes to enhance sales and profitability for the supermarket.# SupermarketDashBoard
