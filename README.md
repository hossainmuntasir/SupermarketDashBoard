This project presents an analysis of a supermarket dataset covering a four-year period. The analysis provides valuable insights into customers' purchasing behavior, shipping preferences, sales frequency, consumer demographics, regional sales, product performance, sales item quantity, impact of discounting on sales, and profitability of different product categories. Key findings include the observation of distinct sales patterns across different months, with September standing out as a month of high sales. The majority of customers preferred the standard class shipping mode, and office supplies had the highest sales contribution. Additionally, customers tended to purchase smaller quantities more frequently, and discounts of 20.0% had the most significant impact on sales. The regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between sales and profit, with sales explaining approximately 44.65% of the variation in profit. These insights can guide decision-making processes to enhance sales and profitability for the supermarket.
